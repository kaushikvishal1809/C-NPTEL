1) Open a terminal. Now spawn three shell processes one after another i.e. first spawn one shell, then from the spawned shell, spawn one new shell and so on. Now, how can you see the PID of the current shell ? How can you see the PID of the shell which is the grandparent of the current shell?
ANS)
    spawn the first process and use "sh" command twice
    "echo $$" to find pid
    "ps" command to list all processes and then search for the parent process of your current shell
     then use the "ps" command again to find its parent (the second shell). Finally, use "ps" one more time to find the parent of the second shell (the first shell).

2) How can you see all the processes (both system & user processes) in your computer? The output can be quite large.  How can you view the output as multipage output ? How can you store the output in a file named process_info?
ANS) 
    ps -e
    ps -e | more
    ps -e | more > process_info
